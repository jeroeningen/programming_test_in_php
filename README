This webapplication uses a really simple version of the MVC-pattern.
With 'a really simple version' I mean, a lot of features are not implemented. This is because I do not need them for now.

This webapplication has three main folders:
- app, containing the views and logic;
- lib, containing the aditional libraries;
- public, containing files that may be accessed by everyone.
Theoratically, you do not have to change code in the 'lib' directory to extend the web application. 
In reality you will have to, because this is a very limited implementation of the MVC pattern.

Notes:
This webapplication assumes that you have enabled the Rewrite engine on your Apache webserver. 
According to the website of Copernica, the Rewrite engine is enabled. 

Known bugs
- Variables which are set in the controller are not accessible in the view, so I need to use the session or write a file to the filesystem.
